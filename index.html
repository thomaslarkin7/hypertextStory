                        <p>You receive a letter from a mysterious distant uncle known as Philip de Thaun, who 
                            propositions you with a mission of great importance. His life’s work has been the 
                            cataloging of fantastical creatures. In his old age however, his ability to chase 
                            down these beasts has waned. He charges you with continuing his work: to document 
                            the remaining creatures on his list. An initial tip from Uncle Philip as well as 
                            clues you pick up along the way will guide you in pursuing these creatures. By the 
                            end of the game you have written a bestiary of your own (the source material) using 
                            all the information you gathered along the way.<br><br>

                            assaulting your nose as you go. Your plan is to address the King directly, but you can’t

                            You travel to the monastery. It takes three days and you are very tired by the end of the 
                            journey. As you approach the holy building a monk by the name of David spots you, bringing 
                            you inside for food and shelter. As you eat you begin to speak with David, telling him of 
                            your missions and  showing him Philip’s note written on the letter. He stares for a moment, 
                            pondering its meaning.
                            <br><br>
                            “It is my opinion, dear friend, that your Uncle may be referring to something of a divine 
                            nature. In all my years of pouring over the texts I have seen but one entity that is above 
                            all of these dominions…”
                            <br><br>
                            “And that is?”
                            <br><br>
                            “And that is God himself my friend. I cannot tell you how to catch he who knows and sees 
                            all, it would be against my sacred beliefs. There is a woman I know of, a witch, whose 
                            dark knowledge may assist you, but I cannot in good conscience give you her name.”
                            <br><br>
                            “I understand. Sorry for wasting your time.”
                            Brother David leaves the room briefly. You look around and notice a few books on a table 
                            in the corner. You race to the small stack and quickly study the cover of each work. You 
                            hear David’s footsteps reapproaching the room and decide you can only take one book, which 
                            do you take?
                            <br><br>
                            The book with an upside down pentagram and wanted poster for a scraggly-looking woman stuffed 
                            inside the cover<br>
                            The book that appears to have the very creature you seek in gold filigree across the top and 
                            bottom of its cover<br>
                            The diary and address book of Brother David

                            Your neighbour, the village’s only doctor, is always the first person who comes to mind 
                            when you need help. You rap on the old man’s door three times, after which you hear the 
                            soft sound of his shuffling footsteps makes their way to the door. He greets you warmly 
                            and invites you inside.
                            <br><br>
                            “You know, my child, I am in need of an apprentice.” He says after you exchange some 
                            pleasantries. “I wouldn’t be able to pay you much, but I would be able to teach you the 
                            ways of my trade before I pass on. I never fathered any children, so one day I could leave 
                            my business to you.”
                            <br><br>
                            You ponder the idea for a while. You’ve always liked your old neighbour, he’s been kind 
                            to you, treating you like his very own child. You accept his offer, and the quest for those 
                            fantastical creatures fades from your mind.

                            You walk past a wealthy bath house, where many men and women were busy cleaning themselves 
                            and socialising. You make your way around the back, ensuring that your presence goes 
                            unnoticed. One of the rear windows is open, and hanging from the sill is a fine outfit, one 
                            fit for a member of the aristocracy. Glancing over both shoulders to check you are alone, 
                            you proceed to pull the garment from its perch and begin to dress yourself. At that moment 
                            you hear a shriek from inside the bath house - before you know it, a head has popped out 
                            from the window above you yelling Thief! Thief! You try to run but the garb you had been 
                            trying so frantically to put on catches beneath your feet, causing you to trip. Before you 
                            manage to make it back to your feet, you are surrounded.

                            As you make you way closer to the castle you pass a travelling showman, he’s asleep by his cart. 
                            You see this as an opportunity to create your disguise. Moving quietly so as to not wake the man, 
                            you rip the red show curtain from its railing and drape it over your shoulders. In the back of the 
                            cart you notice all sorts of props… this pretend spellbook should be perfect!
                            <br><br>
                            Your alchemist costume is rudimentary at best but good enough to get you through the castle gates. 
                            You take a moment to absorb your new grand surroundings before continuing on your way. A servant boy 
                            passes by you, eyeing you with curiosity. To diffuse any suspicions the boy might have, you ask him…

                            You elect to disguise yourself as a member of the clergy, purchasing for yourself a brown 
                            cloak and set of rosary beads from a local merchant. You are spotted almost immediately by 
                            another holy man and directed to go and join the brothers at the scriptorium. You oblige 
                            and follow the man, eventually arriving at a large room full of books, scrolls, pots of ink 
                            and men all writing in a reverent silence.
                            <br><br>
                            Your gaze is drawn to a stack of papers on one of the writing tables, naturally you go and 
                            inspect. There’s works on all manner of supernatural creatures: faeries, phoenixes, dragons 
                            and the like, as well as… ah! Unicorns. You pick up a curious piece of paper that has been 
                            folded three times…

                            That was helpful. You can see that much of the brothers’ work here is centred around many of 
                            the beasts on your list, as well as a slew of others. The room is simply full of information 
                            on fantastical creatures. 
                            <br><br>
                            All at once the room is filled with the booming voice of a man yelling, “All rise for the 
                            entry of his majesty, King Henry!”
                            <br><br>
                            The aura of light coming from the doorway that leads into the scriptorium is obscured by a 
                            girthy man with fiery red hair. The monarch began to make his way around the room slowly, 
                            inspecting the careful work of the brothers.
                            <br><br>
                            “Very fine work indeed, my friends. All this will surely aide me greatly in the capture of 
                            these incredible creatures, the taxidermied remains of which will grace my great hall as 
                            tremendous hunting trophies, as well as signs of my immense power.”
                            <br><br>
                            The thought of this sickens you, but you still need help with your quest. You decide to…

                        Your logic tells you that the woman in the wanted poster is the witch brother David spoke of, 
                        so you snatch the book and make your way out of the monastery’s back door. Running as fast 
                        as your legs will take you, you follow a trail from the monastery to the nearest town. 
                        <br><br>
                        It’s growing dark quickly so you decide to settle in for the evening at the local tavern. 
                        The place is packed to the walls with men and women seeking merriment and dancing partners. 
                        Hoping to join in, you hail one of the beer maidens to fetch you a drink and something to eat. 
                        While you wait for your order you open the book and examine the wanted poster. Lost in your 
                        work, you don’t notice an old woman sit down beside you. 
                        <br><br>
                        “I don’t suppose you’re a witch hunter, are you friend?”
                        <br><br>
                        You glance to your right at the woman, she has on a dark cloak that covers most of her face.
                        <br><br>
                        “No, I don’t suppose I am. I’m seeking the help of the woman in this poster for a… quest.” You 
                        say, kicking yourself for being so honest.
                        <br><br>
                        “Well… I hear she is very powerful. If you come with me, I can take you to her.”
                        <br><br>
                        Forgetting the meal you have on its way, you leave the tavern with the woman. She leads you this 
                        way and that through the streets, until you can’t remember which way you came from. She stops 
                        abruptly at a small door, before passing through it. You follow her inside and the door slams 
                        behind you, leaving you alone with the old woman in the candlelight. 
                        <br><Br>
                        “I apologise to the mystery, you see I have to conceal my identity in public. That wanted poster 
                        is up all over town and has a surprisingly uncanny likeness to myself, I’m almost impressed with 
                        the artist’s handywork.” As she says this, she removes her cloak and reveals herself to indeed be 
                        the woman from the poster.
                        <br><br>
                        “Now for the information you seek, for you see child I saw you coming in my mind’s eye and understand
                         the quest you are on to be that of continuing one Philip de Thaun’s work, am I mistaken?”
                        “No ma’am, you are not.”
                        <br><br>
                        With a smile on her face, she gestures for you to have a seat. 
                        <br><br>
                        “Now luckily for you darling, I am somewhat of an expert on the matter of fantastical creatures. It 
                        just so happens that I’m experimenting with a new form of grimoire to catalogue these things. I call

                         <br><br>
                        You nod your head, a little confused. She hands you what looks like a piece of paper that’s been 
                        folded three times.

                        <br><br>
                        Thinking for a moment, she says, “I’m sorry darling, but that’s the only one I have . Maybe if I can 
                        find a way to make lots of copies of it you could have one but I… I just don’t want to part with my work.”

                        surely that holds the most useful information. You stuff the book inside your coat and wait 
                        for brother David to return, as though nothing had happened. The monk remains with you awhile 
                        and offers for you to stay the night, an invitation you readily accept as the weather outside 
                        has turned foul.

                        Notice that there is a chapter specifically on unicorns.

                        Feel guilty about stealing the generous monk’s possessions and decide to return the book in the

                        You grab the monk’s diary and stuff it into your coat before he returns. After supping with brother 
                        David you thank him for being such a gracious host and tell him you must take your leave of him and 
                        return home. Following a trail behind the monastery, you make your way to a small wooded area where 
                        you won’t be disturbed. There, you sit and open the diary in your lap. Pilfering through the pages 
                        you are initially confused… then terrified. It wasn’t a diary at all, it was a manual for conducting 
                        satanic rituals. Each page was full of Latin verse designed to summon numerous demons, incubi and 
                        succubi. You can’t stop flipping back and forth through the pages, until you come across one that has a 
                        method for human sacrifice. On seeing that, you snap the book shut and decide to bury it. Right before 
                        you stand up however you hear a hissing voice coming from behind you…
                        <br><br>

                        you hear a creak. Then you hear a crack. The next thing you know the entire apparatus has fallen
                        into the moat below, taking you, your *waste* and part of the castle wall with it.

                        begin to rifle through old books and scrolls. In a stack of papers on the desk, you find one 
                        that has been folded three times…

                        That was helpful! You continue to go through the royal alchemist’s things, being careful not 
                        to knock over any of his glass distilling apparatus. On the highest shelf in the corner of the 
                        room you find a book of potions. Aided by the old library ladder, you pluck the book gently 
                        from its dusty perch. You open the weighty tome and flick through its translucent pages. You 
                        see a few potion options that may be of use to you, which do you decide to create?

                        The boy takes you to the King’s counsel room, where he and many other members of the court are 
                        conversing about taxes, land and the Norman invasion of times gone by. You walk timidly into 
                        the room and as people notice your presence they grow quiet.

                        You see the King notice the prop spellbook under your arm and walks over to examine it.

                        “Ah, you’re the alchemist from Normandy I sent for! I never would have guessed, I couldn’t hear

                        <br><br>
                        Thinking quickly you reply, “Not exactly sire, I am said alchemist’s apprentice, he sent me in 
                        his stead. I was raised here in Britain so I don’t have the French accent.”
                        <br><br>
                        The King appears slightly displeased that the person standing in front of him is no more than an

                        <br><br>
                        Without thinking you hand the book to the King, who opens it and begins to flip through the

                        You turn to the chapter on Unicorns. Truth be told there is little there you didn’t already 
                        know. The one useful piece of information that you gleaned from its pages was that Unicorns 
                        cannot be caught by traditional means, and that they have striking similarities in their nature 
                        to Jesus Christ. You fail to see how this is beneficial to you and in a huff of futility, decide 
                        to consult someone else for advice in the morning.

                            You notice a woman’s name and address written inside the cover of the book. Next to her 
                            details are the words, ‘Witch, Expert’. How interesting. It must be for the woman that 
                            brother David spoke of. You remember the wanted poster in the book with the pentagram. 
                            In the dead of night you sneak downstairs to retrieve the poster from the other book. 
                            Folding it carefully, you put it in your pocket for later and return upstairs to your bed 
                            chamber. You will set out for the nearby town in the morning.

                            The rage you feel inside boils over, you simply cannot stand the idea of this man killing 
                            innocent creatures, just to hang them as hunting trophies! It’s despicable. 
                            <br><br>
                            “How dare you even attempt something so cruel, sir! These creatures should be preserved 
                            and documented, not butchered for status. You should be ashamed of yourself.”
                            <br><br>
                            The King’s gaze falls directly upon you, in his eyes you can see a rage and contempt that 
                            equals your own. 
                            <br><br>
                            “How dare I!? How dare you, brother… brother… why I don’t even know your name, in fact 
                            I don’t recall ever seeing your face before! Not only are you an agitator, you are an 
                            imposter as well! Guards, seize this wretched soul and send them to the gallows!”

                        Thinking quickly, you call for the King’s attention. Recalling what you read in the folded 
                        paper, you offer up a hunting technique to the King. 
                        <br><br>
                        “And you say this is for the Unicorn, of all creatures? Well child, if you knew anything at 
                        all you would be aware of the fact that the Unicorn cannot be caught by conventional means. 
                        I have had my best men on the hunt for one for the better part of two years and they have 
                        yielded me no results. Tell me, how do you propose one would capture the beast?”
                        <br><br>
                        Now is your chance to trick the King into helping you. His extensive resources would make your 
                        task a lot easier.
                        <br><br>
                        “If it’s alright with you, your majesty, I would prefer to tell you in private, as this 
                        information is proprietary highly secretive.”
                        <br><br>
                        The King ushers you into an antechamber behind the throne room to speak in private. You decide 
                        to…

                        If you had read the witch’s brochure properly you would have noticed that the Unicorn can’t 
                        be caught by normal means, and either way your quest is not to harm the animal, it is to 
                        document it and ensure its protection… odd choice there friend.

                            You choose a sachet of frankincense-based magic spices. Thought the instructions on the back 
                            say nothing about Unicorns, it does mention that it can enhance the resurrection process of a 
                            creature known as the Phoenix. Unfortunately however, the choice you have made won’t assist 
                            you very much in catching the current creature you’re after.

                        The charisma potion you have selected from the table is designed to improve your ability to 
                        persuade and engage people. After reading the label less than carefully, you consume the whole 
                        bottle. 
                        <br><br>
                        The witch claps her hands together excitedly, “Fantastic choice! The charisma potion is a 
                        personal favourite of mine. Now, if I remember correctly, we left the tavern before you were 
                        able to eat and drink! I feel so rude for dragging you away, please allow me to give you some 
                        supper.”
                        <br><br>
                        She ushers you into the next room, where a young girl is standing above a stove, stirring a 
                        pot of soup. You take a seat next to the old woman at her kitchen table and the girl brings you 
                        each a bowl of soup and a hunk of bread, before sitting down herself.
                        <br><br>

                       You quickly interject, “A friend, I don’t have a name.” The pair of women look a little puzzled, 
                       but quickly move on. As you listen to the idle conversation, you can feel the charisma potion 
                       beginning to work. You remember the methodology written about in the brochure for capturing the 
                       Unicorn and decide to enlist the help of the witch’s maiden daughter. The charisma potion 
                       compels you to…

                            the unicorn… not even an artist hopped up of speed potion. This potion will not be useful

                        You create a sleeping potion, a very potent one at that. You pour the contents into a glass 
                        flask and stopper it with a cork. Tucking the flask into your jacket pocket you make your way 
                        as fast as you can out of the alchemist's laboratory and into the castle yard. 
                        <br>
                        Unfortunately, however, you are incredibly clumsy. You trip over a bucket of apples and send 
                        them rolling across the dirt. As you hit the ground the flask flies from your pocket and 
                        smashes, freeing the potent sleeping potion. You see its effects begin immediately. 
                        <br>
                        Within 30 seconds the entire castle has been put to sleep by the effects of the concoction, 
                        including yourself. As you failed to read the instructions carefully, you missed the fact 
                        that the sleeping potion’s effect lasts for 100 years.

                        the woman who wrote it. You recall her address written on the last page and set out on your

                        The woman’s house was a small, rickety set up, right in the heart of the town. You attempt to

                        panel, it swings open, revealing a small but sweet looking old woman. She ushers you into the

                        manuscripts. It requires the assistance of a maiden, pure of heart. You see, the Unicorn itself 
                        is like a metaphor for Jesus Christ himself; the beast is attracted to maidens because they
                         resemble the bosom of the Virgin Mother. I believe if we were to find a young woman to fit 
                         the bill, maybe dress her up in a blue cloak like the Mother, we may just catch the creature.”
                         <br><br>
                        The King strokes his beard in thought. “I can think of three who would fit this description.

                            horse’s body… you can’t believe the lure has worked! The sweet creature gingerly makes its way 
                            over to Petunia, who hugs the Unicorn gently and strokes its mane. While the creature is subdued, 
                            you move from behind the rock. Quickly, you sketch its likeness, to be properly illustrated 
                            later, and jot down any important notes from the experience. The first creature on your uncle’s 
                            list has been found! Congratulations.

                            Petunia doesn’t take kindly to your advances, no offense but you’re just not her type. 
                            The charisma potion must not have worked.

                            <br><br>
                            You explain your plan to Petunia, showing her mother’s carefully written brochure to her. She seems excited to be 
                            able to help you on your quest. As it was prescribed in the brochure, you make Petunia wear a blue cloak, to mimic 
                            the Virgin Mary. The two of you set out early in the morning and head to the highest peak near the village. It’s a 
                            calm, sunny day. You get Petunia to kneel down on the mountainside in her cloak, arms outstretched, while you go 
                            and hide behind a rock...

                            out from behind some trees. The magnificent creature slowly makes itself seen, it’s 
                            beautiful. Unfortunately, it takes one look at Eleanor and bolts - it looks as though the 
                            girl has had the opposite effect, startling the Unicorn away.

                            Dissatisfied with the outcome Eleanor flies into a rage, cursing the creature, the King

                        Re-reading Uncle Philip’s letter, one name on the list stands out to you in bold lettering: 
                        DRAGON.
                        <br><br>
                        You enter a tavern to purchase a tankard of beer. As you sip on your beer, you take your 
                        time mulling over what little you know about Dragons. You realise that you are not the only 
                        person in the tavern this early in the day, and notice three other people.
                        <br><br>
                        In the hope of finding out more about Dragons, you introduce yourself to:
                        <br>
                        - The Knight

                        <br>
                        - The Merchant

                    <p><font size="6">The Knight</font><br>
                        In a dark corner of the tavern sits a Knight with their dusty shield propped against the table. 
                        They seem to be concentrating on a tattered and dirty scroll in their hands.
                        <br><br>
                        Hearing your footsteps, they look up to see who's approaching them and seem eager for some 
                        company. Striking up conversation, you find that the Knight is on a quest to find a living example of his House Crest - an Elephant. 
                        <br><br>
                        Taking a shine to you, the Knight offers you:
                        <br>
                        - A look at their Shield emblem
                        <br>
                        - Opportunity to read their scroll
                        <br>
                        - Join them on their quest as their Squire

                        Quietly strumming their lute at a deserted table is a charming looking Bard. Known for their 
                        poetic and musical prowess, Bards regale their audiences recounting epic adventures, stories 
                        and sensational news.
                        <br><br>
                        Thinking the Bard could have a song or poem about dragons that could help you in your search 
                        for one, you cautiously approach the seated Bard and cough discreetly to get their attention. 
                        Striking up a friendly conversation, you tell the Bard about your search for a Dragon and your 
                        Uncle Philip's mysterious letter.
                        <br><br>
                        The Bard, intrigued, tells you "Alas, I have no tales of Dragons to recount, though should you 
                        wish a life of adventure and travel, you can accompany my and learn the gift of my trade"
                        <br><br>
                        You can't help yourself and:
                        <br>
                        - Laugh openly at the Bard's offer to apprentice to them
                        <br>
                        - Excitedly accept their offer to apprentice to them

                        Milling about the entrance to the tavern is a richly clothed Merchant. Robed in furs and silk, 
                        the Merchant looks you up and down - your simple but well made clothes indicate there could be 
                        more value to you than first impressions.
                        <br><br>
                        As their rich and exotic clothes indicate, the Merchant travels far and wide finding wares to 
                        sell in different towns. You wonder if they have anything for trade that could help you find a 
                        dragon.
                        <br><br>
                        You size the Merchant up and offer to trade:
                        <br>
                        - A spool of unspun wool
                        <br>
                        - A lute
                        <br>
                        - A tattered scroll
                    </p>

                        As you bend over to get a closer look at the Knight's shield emblem, showing an Elephant, 
                        you accidentally hit your head on the table. 
                        Your head wound is severe, and you fall into a coma, which you never wake from.
                        <br><br>
                        End of Journey.

                        The Knight allows you to briefly read his scroll, before a loud party of ruffians enters the 
                        tavern and he snatches it back.
                        <br><br>
                        You managed to read the following before the Knight snatched the scroll back from you:
                        "...Elephants are the preferred prey of Dragons...venomous breath... winged serpent.”
                        <br><br>
                        You think there could be more useful information about dragons on the scroll, so you:
                        <br>
                        - Offer to buy the scroll
                        <br>

                        Becoming the Knight's Squire sounds like it could provide you with the opportunity to travel to 
                        different lands, meet commoners and royalty alike. This could allow you to capture and document 
                        more of the beasts on Uncle Philip's list, but it could almost certainly leads to dangerous 
                        situations!

                        You're desperate to see if there's more information about dragons on the scroll, so eagerly 
                        offer to buy it from the Knight for 20 gold coins.
                        <br><br>
                        The Knight is greatly offended that you think they would sell their family heirloom which 
                        contains their house emblem. In a rage, the Knight dumps the remainder of his beer on your 
                        head and storms out of the tavern.
                        <br><br>
                        Dejected and soaked with beer, you decide Uncle Philip's list of beasts is too much trouble.

                        You begin to buy the Knight more and more beer and soon they are drunk! The Knight falls into 
                        a drunken stupor. While they are quietly snoring, your rummage through their belongings and 
                        grab the scroll!
                        <br><br>
                        You read the entire scroll passage:
                        "Noble and wise beasts, Elephants are the preferred prey of  Dragons. Armed with a venomous 
                        breath, these devilish winged serpents hold great power of destruction in their serpentine 
                        tails. The only beast the dragon flees from is the roar of the Panther, its sweet breath it 
                        cannot abide by."
                        <br><br>
                        Realising there isn't much more information on the scroll, and that the Knight is beginning 
                        to wake up you hastily leave the tavern and run into a Merchant on your way out.

                        Thinking quickly, you tell the Knight you are an apprentice to the Bard in the tavern, and 
                        think their quest and the wonderful scroll would make a captivating song, regaling all who 
                        hear it about the Knight's honour and nobility.
                        <br><br>
                        The Knight, warming to your praise agrees.
                        The Knight lets you read the entire scroll passage:
                        <br><br>
                        "Noble and wise beasts, Elephants are the preferred prey of  Dragons. Armed with a venomous

                        <br><br>
                        You realise there isn't much more information on the scroll, and while you sing a song using 
                        the scroll's words, it is so terrible that the Knight becomes angry. They pick you up by the 
                        scruff of your neck and march you over to the tavern Bard, telling you "you have much to learn!".

                        <br><br>
                        As you begin your long journey, the Knight explains to you that Elephants are strong and noble 
                        beasts, however, a major predator of the Elephant is the Dragon. 
                        <br><br>
                        Over many nights on your journey, the Knight tells you that Dragons prey on Elephants by laying 
                        in wait at paths elephants frequently travel and kills its prey with its strong, coiling tail. 
                        The Knight ponders aloud - they've heard many stories about Dragon's spitting venom from their 
                        mouths, but are unsure if this venom is fatal or harmless. 
                        <br><br>

                        You slowly approach the elephant so as not to startle it. Sensing a great intelligence and 
                        wisdom in the elephant, you begin to talk to it and retell your travels so far.
                        <br><br>
                        Whether or not the elephant actually understands you, it seems to find you as no threat to it's 
                        own life.
                        You cautiously follow it as it travels well-worn bush paths back to its herd.
                        As you pass a rocky outcrop, the air suddenly starts to shimmer and a loud thud echoes near the 
                        elephant!
                        <br><br>
                        What seems to be a large winged serpent starts to coil its powerful snake-like body around the

                        <br>

                        your body.

                        A great battle begins as you dodge the dragon's tail as it whips around in fury. After what 
                        feels like hours, it seems the dragon is growing weaker and weaker. With one last blow to its 
                        tail, the dragon collapses in a tired heap, unable to move.

                        - Its weakness to the Panther's sweet breath and fearsome roar

                        <br><br>
                        Dejected at your lack of basic skills at trading, you re-think if you're cut out to search for 
                        fantastical beasts from Uncle Philip's list.
                        <br>
                        You decide to return home and live a quiet life with your family.

                        As you tell the Merchant of your search for a dragon to complete Uncle Philip's bestiary, you 
                        spot the Merchant eyeing your lute. 
                        <br><br>
                        Seeing the Merchant's interest in your lute, and realising it would be too bulky to carry on 
                        your adventures, you offer up your lute, inlaid with mother-of-pearl for trade.
                        The Merchant, always looking for a bargain, offers you two trade options.
                        <br><br>
                        You agree to trade your lute for:
                        <br>
                        - An iron Broadsword
                        <br>
                        - More information about dragons

                        You decide to trade your lute for a strong looking iron broadsword.
                        The Merchant greedily chuckles, snatches the lute and gives you the broadsword.
                        You pick the broadsword up thinking it would be perfect to help you capture a dragon. Taking a 
                        closer look at the blade, you decide to give it a quick polish with the hem of your tunic.
                        <br><br>
                        Giving the blade a brisk polish, you feel a sudden pain in your hand. You look down to see your 
                        hand bleeding heavily. The strong looking iron broadsword, is really an old sword, riddled with 
                        rust and covered in paint to look new. In your bleeding hand is a chunk of corroded blade that 
                        has fallen away.
                        <br><br>
                        You spend all your coins on a poultice to heal your cut, unfortunately infection still sets in 
                        and you perish in a fevered state.

                        The Merchant seems somewhat disappointed at your choice, but nevertheless honours the trade 
                        and begins to tell you all the information about Dragons they have collected on their trade 
                        journeys. 
                        <br><br>
                        The Merchant tells you that "Dragons are large, fierce and strong winged serpents that prefer 
                        to hunt elephants in Africa and India, stalking them on the bush tracks the elephants follow. 
                        Despite its venomous breath, a dragon's power lies within its snake-like tail, with unimaginable
                         power to crush whomever it wishes. It also has the power to stir the air and make it shine. 
                         The only known beast the dragon is afeared of is the vainglorious Panther. The swiftest of all 
                         beasts, the Panther can only be caught with trickery when captivated by its own reflection. 
                         The dragon cowers before the Panther's roar and hides from its sweet breath."
                        <br><br>
                        With that, the Merchant begins to pack up their wares, and makes plans to travel further along 
                        their trade route.

                        You reluctantly pull a tattered scroll from your satchel and offer it to the Merchant to 
                        look at. Though you haven't looked at in a while, you recall the scroll featuring beautiful 
                        illuminated images and lettering, indicating the care and expense taken to create it.
                        <br><br>
                        You agree to trade the tattered scroll for:

                        As you stumble back from the sudden weight of the lance, you trip over your own feet and fall 
                        into the nearby well. As you plummet many metres into the dark, damp well, you wonder about all 
                        the wonderful beasts from Uncle Philip's letter and if you'll ever get the chance to see them.

                        The Merchant gives you the old hand mirror in exchange for the tattered scroll. The Merchant 
                        seems smug with this trade, understanding the scroll comes from a noble family. As you step 
                        away and begin to examine the mirror, you notice its handle is heavier than usual. Finding a 
                        latch on the side, you press it, and a small scrap of folded parchment falls out of a hidden 
                        compartment. 
                        <br><br>
                        The parchment reads "No hunter on swiftest steed can catch the Panther, so quick it is. Fastest 
                        of all creatures on earth, the only means to capture the vain beast is to trick it with its own 
                        reflection and captive it will be." Curious though it is, you decide it's time to continue your 
                        search for a dragon.
                        <br><br>
                        As you travel along the road you come to a junction - one path leads East, where a hunting party 
                        is preparing their gear. The other path leads West.
                        <br><br>
                        You decide to:

                        - Ask the hunting party to accompany them on their hunt Eastwards.

                        You walk up to the hunting party and introduce yourself and your quest to find a dragon. 
                        They are a rowdy group, but welcome you to their party with open arms. 
                        <br><br>
                        They mention that while they're excited to help hunt a dragon, they are actually in the midst 
                        of hunting a Panther that has been plaguing their village. The hunters have been chasing the 
                        Panther for days, but it's simply too fast for them to catch! You hatch a plan for the hunters 
                        to trap the Panther using a bit of trickery. 
                        <br><br>
                        To catch the Panther you:
                        <br>
                        - Use a spear
                        <br>

                        As the hunting party make camp, you notice that the Panther has circled back. You think it 
                        might try to attack the hunters while they are resting.
                        <br><br>
                        Thinking there is no time to lose, you decide to use the spear laying beside you. As the 
                        Panther enters the camp, you jump up with a loud battle cry and throw the spear at the Panther!
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, your aim was off and the spear whizzes past some shrubs, missing the Panther 
                        entirely. Before you can blink, the Panther launches itself at you and strikes you down! The 
                        hunters were right - the Panther truly is the fastest beast.

                        rope. Unfortunately all the stories the Hunter told you are true - the Panther is so incredibly 
                        fast you can't seem to get any grip on it as it squirms and moves in your grasp. Before you know 
                        it, the Panther has thrown you to the ground and all you can see is the Panther's cloud of breath

                        While it is captivated by its own reflection, you take the opportunity to bind it so it can't

                        argument erupts between you and the hunting party over what share of the gold everyone will get.

                        As the argument gets louder, you and the hunter's begin to push each other around. A hunter

                        to shimmer and shine and before you know it a fearsome serpent with wings appears!

                        Dragon and as one of its enemies has let out a vicious snarl and a sweet-smelling breath comes from 
                        its mouth.
                        <br><br>

                        for a closer look...

                                <p>风拂着你的帆。您的船员早已抛弃了这艘船，因为该船pre可危
                                        向海岸线上锯齿​​状的岩石。这个岛甚至都不应该在这里。没有在任何地图上。你
                                        许多错误的决定导致您到这一点。随着您的船越来越靠近海岸线，
                                        海浪在沉船的侧面碰撞并起泡沫，您最后决定放弃船身并潜水
                                        落水。您疯狂地向岸边游泳。气喘吁吁地吞食盐水。您到达了感觉就像沙丘的感觉
                                        随着波浪在你周围破裂而崩溃...
                                        <br><br>
                                        The wind lashes at your sails. Your crewmates have long since abandoned the vessel as it veers precariously
                                        towards jagged rocks on the shoreline. This island shouldn't even be here. It wasn't on any maps. You rue 
                                        the many wrong decisions that have led you to this point. As your boat inches closer and closer towards the shoreline,
                                        waves crashing and foaming against the side of the sinking ship, you make one last decision to abandon ship and dive 
                                        overboard. You swim frantically towards the shore. Panting, puffing, swallowing saltwater. You reach what feels like a sandbank
                                        and collapse as the waves break around you...
                                </p>
                                <p>You awake, dazed and confused. Silence surrounds you. As the sun breaks through the clouds on this god-forsaken island
                                        you think to yourself "Something has to be done." Do you:
