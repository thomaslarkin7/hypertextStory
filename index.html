                A Bestiary is a text or manuscript that contains descriptions about animals – real and mythical – 
                which stood as allegories for Christian moral codes. Bestiaries were popular in England during the 
                Middle Ages and the descriptions were generally accompanied by beautiful hand-drawn illustrations.

                                        bestiaries and the creatures that went into developing the Fantastic

                                        <strong>What is a Bestiary?</strong><br>
                                        A bestiary is a text or manuscript that contains descriptions about 
                                        animals – real and mythical – and sometimes plants and environments, 
                                        which stood as allegories for Christian moral codes. Because of this, 
                                        they were used as religious texts and incorporated into sermons by the 
                                        Church. Bestiaries were popular in England during the Middle Ages and 
                                        the descriptions were generally accompanied by beautiful hand-drawn 
                                        illustrations. <br><br>
                                        <div id = "bestiaryImg">
                                            <img class = "bestiaryIMG" src="orgSketches/bestiaryPage2.JPG" alt="Bestiary Cover Image">
                                        </div><br><br>
                                        Not only are bestiaries historical religious texts, but they also serve 
                                        as an interesting example of manuscript production – a bestiary would be 
                                        copied by hand to create a new copy or version. Because of this version 
                                        process, bestiaries are sometimes categorised as First families 
                                        (earlier or first version) or Secondary families (later versions) 
                                        and/or Transitional (versions that are the bridge between First and 
                                        Secondary families). <br><br>

                                        <strong>What bestiary was used for 'A Fantastic Bestiary'?</strong><br>
                                        The bestiary used in this Choose Your Own Adventure is an early 13th 
                                        Century Latin version from central or northern England, held in the 
                                        British Library’s collection, shelfmark: Royal MS 12 C. xix.<br><br>
                                        This version is related to an earlier bestiary <a href = "https://www.themorgan.org/collection/worksop-bestiary" target = "_blank">
                                            (c. 1185) from the Worksop Priory</a>,
                                         Nottinghamshire. It is also related to a later bestiary 
                                         <a href = "http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/240115/unknown-maker-northumberland-bestiary-english-about-1250-1260/" target = "_blank">
                                            (c. 1250-1260) from Alnwick Castle
                                        </a>.
                                          Because of these relationships, Royal MS 12 C. xix is considered a 
                                         transitional bestiary that shows the changes or evolutions between a First 
                                         (Worksop Priory) and Second (Alnwick Castle) Family bestiaries. It is also 
                                         identified as missing several folios, or pages.

                                        While the specific creator of this bestiary is unknown, it is based off 
                                        the Greek Physiologus and the Etymologiae of St. Isidore of Seville. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Copying or writing illuminated manuscripts (texts with illustrations) 
                                        was usually undertaken by scribes and these beautiful works were created 
                                        for wealthy aristocracy or the clergy - people who had the wealth to 
                                        create expensive manuscripts, and could also understand latin, the 
                                        language most manuscripts were written in. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Royal MS 12 C. xix, with its bright illustrations, encircled by gold 
                                        shows that it would have been an expensive manuscript to make.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Other authors of medieval bestiaries that were frequently copied include 
                                        Guillaume le Clerc, a Norman cleric and Old French poet, and Philip de 
                                        Thaon, an Anglo-Norman poet who was used as inspiration for A Fantastic 
                                        Bestiary.

                                        <Strong>What influences have bestiaries had on modern culture?</Strong><br>
                                        Medieval bestiaries and the creatures within them have impacted on modern 
                                        popular culture greatly. Many of the mythical creatures within bestiaries
                                         have become widely popular in genres such as Fantasy fiction, television 
                                         and film, to classical texts and artworks, music and the performing arts.

                                                The crocodile is born and lives in the Nile river in Egypt and has sharp teeth 
                                                and claws. While its skin is so hard that it affected by hard blows/attacks, 
                                                its belly is slightly more vulnerable. Only two animals can kill a crocodile 
                                                - the Sawfish (cutting the crocodiles belly) and the Hydrus (by entering the 
                                                crocodile’s mouth and killing it from the inside). In many bestiaries, 
                                                crocodiles are said to cry or weep after eating people.

                                            Weasels are depicted as ‘unclean’ animals that shouldn’t be eaten by 
                                            people. Despite this, they are known for being very clever and 
                                            skilled in medicine. It is the only creature that can kill a 
                                            basilisk.  In bestiaries, weasels represent people who hear the 
                                            teachings of god, but decide not to act on these learnings.

                                            In this illustration two ostriches can be seen - one gazing at the 
                                            stars as ostriches would only lay eggs when the Pleiades constellation
                                            was visible, while the other may be burying its eggs in sand. The 
                                            ostrich is an allegory for how people should forget the earthly 
                                            world, and focus on heaven or spiritual endeavours.

                            cataloging of fantastical creatures. In his old age however, his ability to chase 
                            down these beasts has waned. He charges you with continuing his work: to document 
                            the remaining creatures on his list. An initial tip from Uncle Philip as well as 
                            clues you pick up along the way will guide you in pursuing these creatures. By the 
                            end of the game you have written a bestiary of your own using 
                            all the information you gathered along the way.<br><br>

                            your missions and  showing him Philip’s note written on the letter. He stares for a moment, 
                            pondering its meaning.

                            <br><br>
                            “And that is God himself my friend. I cannot tell you how to catch he who knows and sees 
                            all, it would be against my sacred beliefs. There is a woman I know of, a witch, whose 
                            dark knowledge may assist you, but I cannot in good conscience give you her name.”

                            “I understand. Sorry for wasting your time.”
                            Brother David leaves the room briefly. You look around and notice a few books on a table 
                            in the corner. You race to the small stack and quickly study the cover of each work. You 
                            hear David’s footsteps reapproaching the room and decide you can only take one book, which 
                            do you take?

                            when you need help. You rap on the old man’s door three times, after which you hear the 
                            soft sound of his shuffling footsteps makes their way to the door. He greets you warmly 
                            and invites you inside.
                            <br><br>
                            “You know, my child, I am in need of an apprentice.” He says after you exchange some 
                            pleasantries. “I wouldn’t be able to pay you much, but I would be able to teach you the 
                            ways of my trade before I pass on. I never fathered any children, so one day I could leave 
                            my business to you.”
                            <br><br>
                            You ponder the idea for a while. You’ve always liked your old neighbour, he’s been kind 
                            to you, treating you like his very own child. You accept his offer, and the quest for those 
                            fantastical creatures fades from your mind.

                            you proceed to pull the garment from its perch and begin to dress yourself. At that moment 
                            you hear a shriek from inside the bath house - before you know it, a head has popped out 
                            from the window above you yelling Thief! Thief! You try to run but the garb you had been 
                            trying so frantically to put on catches beneath your feet, causing you to trip. Before you 
                            manage to make it back to your feet, you are surrounded.

                            As you make you way closer to the castle you pass a travelling showman, he’s asleep by his cart. 
                            You see this as an opportunity to create your disguise. Moving quietly so as to not wake the man, 
                            you rip the red show curtain from its railing and drape it over your shoulders. In the back of the 
                            cart you notice all sorts of props… this pretend spellbook should be perfect!
                            <br><br>
                            Your alchemist costume is rudimentary at best but good enough to get you through the castle gates. 
                            You take a moment to absorb your new grand surroundings before continuing on your way. A servant boy 
                            passes by you, eyeing you with curiosity. To diffuse any suspicions the boy might have, you ask him…
                            <br><br>
                            A member of the aristocracy<br>

                                The Clergy Disguise
                            </div>
                        <p><br>
                            You elect to disguise yourself as a member of the clergy, purchasing for yourself a brown 
                            cloak and set of rosary beads from a local merchant. You are spotted almost immediately by 
                            another holy man and directed to go and join the brothers at the scriptorium. You oblige 
                            and follow the man, eventually arriving at a large room full of books, scrolls, pots of ink 
                            and men all writing in a reverent silence.
                            <br><br>
                            Your gaze is drawn to a stack of papers on one of the writing tables, naturally you go and 
                            inspect. There’s works on all manner of supernatural creatures: faeries, phoenixes, dragons 
                            and the like, as well as… ah! Unicorns. You pick up a curious piece of paper that has been 
                            folded three times…
                            <br><br>

                            <br><br>
                            That was helpful. You can see that much of the brothers’ work here is centred around many of 
                            the beasts on your list, as well as a slew of others. The room is simply full of information 
                            on fantastical creatures. 
                            <br><br>
                            All at once the room is filled with the booming voice of a man yelling, “All rise for the 
                            entry of his majesty, King Henry!”
                            <br><br>
                            The aura of light coming from the doorway that leads into the scriptorium is obscured by a 
                            girthy man with fiery red hair. The monarch began to make his way around the room slowly, 
                            inspecting the careful work of the brothers.
                            <br><br>
                            “Very fine work indeed, my friends. All this will surely aide me greatly in the capture of 
                            these incredible creatures, the taxidermied remains of which will grace my great hall as 
                            tremendous hunting trophies, as well as signs of my immense power.”
                            <br><br>
                            The thought of this sickens you, but you still need help with your quest. You decide to…
                            <br><br>
                            Chastise the King for wanting to help the creatures<br>

                                The Pentagram and the Wanted Posted
                            </div>
                        <p><br>
                        Your logic tells you that the woman in the wanted poster is the witch brother David spoke of, 
                        so you snatch the book and make your way out of the monastery’s back door. Running as fast 
                        as your legs will take you, you follow a trail from the monastery to the nearest town. 
                        <br><br>
                        It’s growing dark quickly so you decide to settle in for the evening at the local tavern. 
                        The place is packed to the walls with men and women seeking merriment and dancing partners. 
                        Hoping to join in, you hail one of the beer maidens to fetch you a drink and something to eat. 
                        While you wait for your order you open the book and examine the wanted poster. Lost in your 
                        work, you don’t notice an old woman sit down beside you. 
                        <br><br>
                        “I don’t suppose you’re a witch hunter, are you friend?”
                        <br><br>
                        You glance to your right at the woman, she has on a dark cloak that covers most of her face.
                        <br><br>
                        “No, I don’t suppose I am. I’m seeking the help of the woman in this poster for a… quest.” You 
                        say, kicking yourself for being so honest.
                        <br><br>
                        “Well… I hear she is very powerful. If you come with me, I can take you to her.”
                        <br><br>
                        Forgetting the meal you have on its way, you leave the tavern with the woman. She leads you this 
                        way and that through the streets, until you can’t remember which way you came from. She stops 
                        abruptly at a small door, before passing through it. You follow her inside and the door slams 
                        behind you, leaving you alone with the old woman in the candlelight. 
                        <br><Br>
                        “I apologise to the mystery, you see I have to conceal my identity in public. That wanted poster 
                        is up all over town and has a surprisingly uncanny likeness to myself, I’m almost impressed with 
                        the artist’s handywork.” As she says this, she removes her cloak and reveals herself to indeed be 
                        the woman from the poster.
                        <br><br>
                        “Now for the information you seek, for you see child I saw you coming in my mind’s eye and understand
                         the quest you are on to be that of continuing one Philip de Thaun’s work, am I mistaken?”
                        “No ma’am, you are not.”
                        <br><br>
                        With a smile on her face, she gestures for you to have a seat. 
                        <br><br>
                        “Now luckily for you darling, I am somewhat of an expert on the matter of fantastical creatures. It 
                        just so happens that I’m experimenting with a new form of grimoire to catalogue these things. I call
                         it a brochure, care to take a look?”
                         <br><br>
                        You nod your head, a little confused. She hands you what looks like a piece of paper that’s been 
                        folded three times.
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        Thinking for a moment, she says, “I’m sorry darling, but that’s the only one I have . Maybe if I can 
                        find a way to make lots of copies of it you could have one but I… I just don’t want to part with my work.”
                        <br><br>
                        Desperate to continue your quest, you…
                        <br>
                        Push the old lady over, stealing the brochure and running away as fast as you can with the new information.
                        <br>

                        for brother David to return, as though nothing had happened. The monk remains with you awhile 
                        and offers for you to stay the night, an invitation you readily accept as the weather outside 
                        has turned foul.

                        <br><br>
                        Notice a woman’s address written inside the cover, with the words ‘Witch, Expert’ next to it.

                        Notice that there is a chapter specifically on unicorns.
                        <br>
                        Feel guilty about stealing the generous monk’s possessions and decide to return the book in the

                        You grab the monk’s diary and stuff it into your coat before he returns. After supping with brother 
                        David you thank him for being such a gracious host and tell him you must take your leave of him and 
                        return home. Following a trail behind the monastery, you make your way to a small wooded area where 
                        you won’t be disturbed. There, you sit and open the diary in your lap. Pilfering through the pages 
                        you are initially confused… then terrified. It wasn’t a diary at all, it was a manual for conducting 
                        satanic rituals. Each page was full of Latin verse designed to summon numerous demons, incubi and 
                        succubi. You can’t stop flipping back and forth through the pages, until you come across one that has a 
                        method for human sacrifice. On seeing that, you snap the book shut and decide to bury it. Right before 
                        you stand up however you hear a hissing voice coming from behind you…
                        <br><br>

                        <p><br>
                        The boy takes you to the King’s counsel room, where he and many other members of the court are 
                        conversing about taxes, land and the Norman invasion of times gone by. You walk timidly into 
                        the room and as people notice your presence they grow quiet. 
                        <br><br>
                        “And who might you be there, child?”
                        <br><br>
                        Slightly afraid, you reply, “A friend, your majesty.”
                        <br><br>
                        You see the King notice the prop spellbook under your arm and walks over to examine it.
                        <br><br>
                        “Ah, you’re the alchemist from Normandy I sent for! I never would have guessed, I couldn’t hear 
                        it in your accent.”
                        <br><br>
                        Thinking quickly you reply, “Not exactly sire, I am said alchemist’s apprentice, he sent me in 
                        his stead. I was raised here in Britain so I don’t have the French accent.”
                        <br><br>
                        The King appears slightly displeased that the person standing in front of him is no more than an 
                        apprentice, he was hoping for an expert.
                        <br><br>
                        “Well I hope you don’t mind me asking, but may I see the contents of your book there? For 
                        verification purposes.”
                        <br><br>
                        Without thinking you hand the book to the King, who opens it and begins to flip through the 
                        pages. You see an enraged look growing across his face.
                        <br><br>
                        “It appears..” the King bellows, “...that the person standing before us is an imposter, most 
                        likely trying to pilfer me for money! The book I hold in my hands is entirely blank, except 
                        for the ornate cover. Guards, seize this con artist!”

                        to Jesus Christ. You fail to see how this is beneficial to you and in a huff of futility, decide

                        I have had my best men on the hunt for one for the better part of two years and they have 
                        yielded me no results. Tell me, how do you propose one would capture the beast?”

                        <p><br>
                        You create a sleeping potion, a very potent one at that. You pour the contents into a glass 
                        flask and stopper it with a cork. Tucking the flask into your jacket pocket you make your way 
                        as fast as you can out of the alchemist's laboratory and into the castle yard. 
                        <br>
                        Unfortunately, however, you are incredibly clumsy. You trip over a bucket of apples and send 
                        them rolling across the dirt. As you hit the ground the flask flies from your pocket and 
                        smashes, freeing the potent sleeping potion. You see its effects begin immediately. 
                        <br>
                        Within 30 seconds the entire castle has been put to sleep by the effects of the concoction, 
                        including yourself. As you failed to read the instructions carefully, you missed the fact 
                        that the sleeping potion’s effect lasts for 100 years. 
                        <br><br>
                        Until then, old timer.

                                The Charisma Potion
                            </div>
                        <p><br>
                        You concoct the charisma potion and stow it in your jacket pocket before making your way out of 
                        the alchemist’s laboratory. After reading that brochure you decide to seek the help of another, 
                        the woman who wrote it. You recall her address written on the last page and set out on your 
                        journey.
                        <br><br>
                        The woman’s house was a small, rickety set up, right in the heart of the town. You attempt to 
                        knock gingerly on the small front door but before you knuckles can meet the wood of the door 
                        panel, it swings open, revealing a small but sweet looking old woman. She ushers you into the 
                        next room, where a young girl is standing above a stove, stirring a pot of soup. You take a 
                        seat next to the old woman at her kitchen table and the girl brings you each a bowl of soup 
                        and a hunk of bread, before sitting down herself.
                        <br><br>
                        “Traveller, this is my daughter, Petunia. Petunia, this…”
                        <br><br>
                      You quickly interject, “A friend, I don’t have a name.” The pair of women look a little puzzled, 
                      but quickly move on. As you listen to the idle conversation, you can feel the charisma potion 
                      beginning to work. You remember the methodology written about in the brochure for capturing the 
                      Unicorn and decide to enlist the help of the witch’s maiden daughter. The charisma potion compels 
                      you to…
                      <br><br>
                      Pay Petunia a compliment
                      <br>
                      Make a move on Petunia
                      <br>
                      Ask Petunia for a favor
                      
                        <br><br>

                        <p><br>
                        “You think you can extort me, cretin!?” the King booms. The sound of his yelling can be 
                        heard by all in the room next door. The guards are called to apprehend you and you are 
                        tortured in the dungeon below the castle for treason. Who knew the King had such a short 
                        temper?

                        <p><br>
                        “Listen…” you begin. “The technique I have in mind has been developed from reading ancient 
                        manuscripts. It requires the assistance of a maiden, pure of heart. You see, the Unicorn itself 
                        is like a metaphor for Jesus Christ himself; the beast is attracted to maidens because they
                         resemble the bosom of the Virgin Mother. I believe if we were to find a young woman to fit 
                         the bill, maybe dress her up in a blue cloak like the Mother, we may just catch the creature.”
                         <br><br>
                        The King strokes his beard in thought. “I can think of three who would fit this description. 
                        The first is my sublime daughter, Eleanor. She is fair and of a good sort. The second is her 
                        lady in waiting, Daphne. I’ve always known her to be honest and caring. There is also the 
                        servant girl, Mildred, I’ve never known her to steal anything from me at the very least.”
                        <br><br>
                        You decide to choose…

                        <p><br>
                            You tell Petunia that her soup is delicious and that she’s a world-class cook. She appears very 
                            flattered. “Listen, you’ve been so kind, if there’s anything I can help you with, I’d be happy 
                            to.”
                            <br><br>
                            You explain your plan to Petunia, showing her mother’s carefully written brochure to her. She 
                            seems excited to be able to help you on your quest. As it was prescribed in the brochure, you 
                            make Petunia wear a blue cloak, to mimic the Virgin Mary. The two of you set out early in the 
                            morning and head to the highest peak near the village. It’s a calm, sunny day. You get Petunia 
                            to kneel down on the mountainside in her cloak, arms outstretched, while you go and hide behind 
                            a rock...

                            horse’s body… you can’t believe the lure has worked! The sweet creature gingerly makes its way 
                            over to Petunia, who hugs the Unicorn gently and strokes its mane. While the creature is subdued, 
                            you move from behind the rock. Quickly, you sketch its likeness, to be properly illustrated 
                            later, and jot down any important notes from the experience. The first creature on your uncle’s 
                            list has been found! Congratulations.

                            escape before the King’s men can butcher it. As for yourself, you run into the trees,

                            The magnificent creature slowly makes itself seen, it’s beautiful. The Unicorn makes its way 
                            over, gingerly at first, to the girl. Mildred opens her arms to greet the creature, taking 
                            it in close for a tender hug.
                            <br><br>
                            While this is happening you quickly take down some notes about the creature, noting its 
                            form and doing a quick sketch of the animal. Thankfully, you were able to speak to Mildred 
                            in private before commencing the operation and you and her agree to allow the creature to 
                            escape before the King’s men can butcher it. As for yourself, you run into the trees, 
                            remaining hidden from the King’s guards for several days until the coast is clear.

                        You enter a tavern to purchase a tankard of beer. As you sip on your beer, you take your 
                        time mulling over what little you know about Dragons. You realise that you are not the only 
                        person in the tavern this early in the day, and notice three other people.
                        <br><br>

                        In a dark corner of the tavern sits a Knight with their dusty shield propped against the table. 
                        They seem to be concentrating on a tattered and dirty scroll in their hands.
                        <br><br>
                        Hearing your footsteps, they look up to see who's approaching them and seem eager for some 
                        company. Striking up conversation, you find that the Knight is on a quest to find a living example of his House Crest - an Elephant. 
                        <br><br>
                        Taking a shine to you, the Knight offers you:
                        <br>
                        - A look at their Shield emblem
                        <br>
                        - Opportunity to read their scroll

                    <p><br>
                        Quietly strumming their lute at a deserted table is a charming looking Bard. Known for their 
                        poetic and musical prowess, Bards regale their audiences recounting epic adventures, stories 
                        and sensational news.
                        <br><br>
                        Thinking the Bard could have a song or poem about dragons that could help you in your search 
                        for one, you cautiously approach the seated Bard and cough discreetly to get their attention. 
                        Striking up a friendly conversation, you tell the Bard about your search for a Dragon and your 
                        Uncle Philip's mysterious letter.
                        <br><br>
                        The Bard, intrigued, tells you "Alas, I have no tales of Dragons to recount, though should you 
                        wish a life of adventure and travel, you can accompany my and learn the gift of my trade"
                        <br><br>
                        You can't help yourself and:
                        <br>
                        - Laugh openly at the Bard's offer to apprentice to them
                        <br>
                        - Excitedly accept their offer to apprentice to them

                <div id = "bodytext" class = "D2c" class = "bodyTextD">

                                The Merchant
                            </div>
                    <p><br>
                        Milling about the entrance to the tavern is a richly clothed Merchant. Robed in furs and silk, 
                        the Merchant looks you up and down - your simple but well made clothes indicate there could be 
                        more value to you than first impressions.
                        <br><br>
                        As their rich and exotic clothes indicate, the Merchant travels far and wide finding wares to 
                        sell in different towns. You wonder if they have anything for trade that could help you find a 
                        dragon.
                        <br><br>
                        You size the Merchant up and offer to trade:
                        <br>
                        - A spool of unspun wool
                        <br>
                        - A lute
                        <br>
                        - A tattered scroll
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p><br>
                        As you bend over to get a closer look at the Knight's shield emblem, showing an Elephant, 
                        you accidentally hit your head on the table. 
                        Your head wound is severe, and you fall into a coma, which you never wake from.
                        <br><br>
                        End of Journey.

                    <p><br>
                        The Knight allows you to briefly read his scroll, before a loud party of ruffians enters the 
                        tavern and he snatches it back.
                        <br><br>
                        You managed to read the following before the Knight snatched the scroll back from you:
                        "...Elephants are the preferred prey of Dragons...venomous breath... winged serpent.”
                        <br><br>
                        You think there could be more useful information about dragons on the scroll, so you:
                        <br>
                        - Offer to buy the scroll
                        <br>
                        - Steal the scroll
                        <br>
                        - Offer to make a song based on the Knight's quest and the content of the scroll

                        Becoming the Knight's Squire sounds like it could provide you with the opportunity to travel to 
                        different lands, meet commoners and royalty alike. This could allow you to capture and document 
                        more of the beasts on Uncle Philip's list, but it could almost certainly leads to dangerous 
                        situations!
                        <br><br>
                        You take a moment to make sure you really do want to become a Squire:
                        <br>
                        - Graciously decline the Knight's Offer

                        - Accept the Knight's Offer with thanks

                    <p><br>
                        You're desperate to see if there's more information about dragons on the scroll, so eagerly 
                        offer to buy it from the Knight for 20 gold coins.
                        <br><br>
                        The Knight is greatly offended that you think they would sell their family heirloom which 
                        contains their house emblem. In a rage, the Knight dumps the remainder of his beer on your 
                        head and storms out of the tavern.
                        <br><br>
                        Dejected and soaked with beer, you decide Uncle Philip's list of beasts is too much trouble.
                        <br><br>
                        End of Journey.

                        You begin to buy the Knight more and more beer and soon they are drunk! The Knight falls into 
                        a drunken stupor. While they are quietly snoring, your rummage through their belongings and 
                        grab the scroll!
                        <br><br>
                        You read the entire scroll passage:
                        "Noble and wise beasts, Elephants are the preferred prey of  Dragons. Armed with a venomous 
                        breath, these devilish winged serpents hold great power of destruction in their serpentine 
                        tails. The only beast the dragon flees from is the roar of the Panther, its sweet breath it 
                        cannot abide by."
                        <br><br>
                        Realising there isn't much more information on the scroll, and that the Knight is beginning 
                        to wake up you hastily leave the tavern and run into a Merchant on your way out.

                        You notice the Knight getting more anxious about the scroll and your interest in it. 
                        Thinking quickly, you tell the Knight you are an apprentice to the Bard in the tavern, and 
                        think their quest and the wonderful scroll would make a captivating song, regaling all who 
                        hear it about the Knight's honour and nobility.
                        <br><br>
                        The Knight, warming to your praise agrees.
                        The Knight lets you read the entire scroll passage:
                        <br><br>
                        "Noble and wise beasts, Elephants are the preferred prey of  Dragons. Armed with a venomous 
                        breath, these devilish winged serpents hold great power of destruction in their serpentine 
                        tails. The only beast the dragon flees from is the roar of the Panther, its sweet breath it 
                        cannot abide by. "
                        <br><br>
                        You realise there isn't much more information on the scroll, and while you sing a song using 
                        the scroll's words, it is so terrible that the Knight becomes angry. They pick you up by the 
                        scruff of your neck and march you over to the tavern Bard, telling you "you have much to learn!".
                        <br><br>

                    <p><br>
                        As the Knight's new Squire, you are eager to set off on the Knight's quest to find a living 
                        Elephant!
                        <br><br>
                        As you begin your long journey, the Knight explains to you that Elephants are strong and noble 
                        beasts, however, a major predator of the Elephant is the Dragon. 
                        <br><br>
                        Over many nights on your journey, the Knight tells you that Dragons prey on Elephants by laying 
                        in wait at paths elephants frequently travel and kills its prey with its strong, coiling tail. 
                        The Knight ponders aloud - they've heard many stories about Dragon's spitting venom from their 
                        mouths, but are unsure if this venom is fatal or harmless. 
                        <br><br>
                        Finally you reach lands where Elephants are said to roam freely!

                        You slowly approach the elephant so as not to startle it. Sensing a great intelligence and 
                        wisdom in the elephant, you begin to talk to it and retell your travels so far.
                        <br><br>
                        Whether or not the elephant actually understands you, it seems to find you as no threat to it's

                        You cautiously follow it as it travels well-worn bush paths back to its herd.
                        As you pass a rocky outcrop, the air suddenly starts to shimmer and a loud thud echoes near the 
                        elephant!
                        <br><br>
                        What seems to be a large winged serpent starts to coil its powerful snake-like body around the

                        <br>
                        Thinking quickly, you ready your weapon and spring to action!

                        A great battle begins as you dodge the dragon's tail as it whips around in fury. After what 
                        feels like hours, it seems the dragon is growing weaker and weaker. With one last blow to its 
                        tail, the dragon collapses in a tired heap, unable to move.

                    <p><br>
                        As you tell the Merchant of your search for a dragon to complete Uncle Philip's bestiary, you 
                        spot the Merchant eyeing your lute. 
                        <br><br>
                        Seeing the Merchant's interest in your lute, and realising it would be too bulky to carry on 
                        your adventures, you offer up your lute, inlaid with mother-of-pearl for trade.
                        The Merchant, always looking for a bargain, offers you two trade options.
                        <br><br>
                        You agree to trade your lute for:
                        <br>
                        - An iron Broadsword
                        <br>
                        - More information about dragons

                    <p><br>
                        You decide to trade your lute for a strong looking iron broadsword.
                        The Merchant greedily chuckles, snatches the lute and gives you the broadsword.
                        You pick the broadsword up thinking it would be perfect to help you capture a dragon. Taking a 
                        closer look at the blade, you decide to give it a quick polish with the hem of your tunic.
                        <br><br>
                        Giving the blade a brisk polish, you feel a sudden pain in your hand. You look down to see your 
                        hand bleeding heavily. The strong looking iron broadsword, is really an old sword, riddled with 
                        rust and covered in paint to look new. In your bleeding hand is a chunk of corroded blade that 
                        has fallen away.
                        <br><br>
                        You spend all your coins on a poultice to heal your cut, unfortunately infection still sets in 
                        and you perish in a fevered state.

                    <p><br>
                        The Merchant seems somewhat disappointed at your choice, but nevertheless honours the trade 
                        and begins to tell you all the information about Dragons they have collected on their trade 
                        journeys. 
                        <br><br>
                        The Merchant tells you that "Dragons are large, fierce and strong winged serpents that prefer 
                        to hunt elephants in Africa and India, stalking them on the bush tracks the elephants follow. 
                        Despite its venomous breath, a dragon's power lies within its snake-like tail, with unimaginable
                         power to crush whomever it wishes. It also has the power to stir the air and make it shine. 
                         The only known beast the dragon is afeared of is the vainglorious Panther. The swiftest of all 
                         beasts, the Panther can only be caught with trickery when captivated by its own reflection. 
                         The dragon cowers before the Panther's roar and hides from its sweet breath."
                        <br><br>
                        With that, the Merchant begins to pack up their wares, and makes plans to travel further along 
                        their trade route.
                        <br><br>

                        You reluctantly pull a tattered scroll from your satchel and offer it to the Merchant to 
                        look at. Though you haven't looked at in a while, you recall the scroll featuring beautiful 
                        illuminated images and lettering, indicating the care and expense taken to create it.
                        <br><br>
                        You agree to trade the tattered scroll for:

                        As you stumble back from the sudden weight of the lance, you trip over your own feet and fall 
                        into the nearby well. As you plummet many metres into the dark, damp well, you wonder about all 
                        the wonderful beasts from Uncle Philip's letter and if you'll ever get the chance to see them.

                    <p><br>
                        The Merchant gives you the old hand mirror in exchange for the tattered scroll. The Merchant 
                        seems smug with this trade, understanding the scroll comes from a noble family. As you step 
                        away and begin to examine the mirror, you notice its handle is heavier than usual. Finding a 
                        latch on the side, you press it, and a small scrap of folded parchment falls out of a hidden 
                        compartment. 
                        <br><br>
                        The parchment reads "No hunter on swiftest steed can catch the Panther, so quick it is. Fastest 
                        of all creatures on earth, the only means to capture the vain beast is to trick it with its own 
                        reflection and captive it will be." Curious though it is, you decide it's time to continue your 
                        search for a dragon.

                        As you travel along the road you come to a junction - one path leads East, where a hunting party

                        <br><br>
                        You decide to:

                        - Ask the hunting party to accompany them on their hunt Eastwards.

                        hostile and seems deserted of life or edible plants.
                        <br><br>
                        You slowly waste away, losing strength and perish in the wilderness.

                        <br><br>
                        They mention that while they're excited to help hunt a dragon, they are actually in the midst 
                        of hunting a Panther that has been plaguing their village. The hunters have been chasing the 
                        Panther for days, but it's simply too fast for them to catch! You hatch a plan for the hunters 
                        to trap the Panther using a bit of trickery. 
                        <br><br>
                        To catch the Panther you:
                        <br>
                        - Use a spear
                        <br>
                        - Use a coil of rope

                        <br><br>
                        Thinking there is no time to lose, you decide to use the spear laying beside you. As the 
                        Panther enters the camp, you jump up with a loud battle cry and throw the spear at the Panther!
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, your aim was off and the spear whizzes past some shrubs, missing the Panther 
                        entirely. Before you can blink, the Panther launches itself at you and strikes you down! The 
                        hunters were right - the Panther truly is the fastest beast.

                        rope. Unfortunately all the stories the Hunter told you are true - the Panther is so incredibly 
                        fast you can't seem to get any grip on it as it squirms and moves in your grasp. Before you know 
                        it, the Panther has thrown you to the ground and all you can see is the Panther's cloud of breath 
                        and dark eyes as it pounces on you.

                        Panther, angling the hand-mirror into its line of sight. The Panther's normally alert gaze 
                        transforms into a dreamy look as it seems to be transfixed by its own reflection in the mirror! 
                        While it is captivated by its own reflection, you take the opportunity to bind it so it can't

                        The Merchant's eyes widen as they realise the rare creature before it. The Merchant offers a 
                        huge amount of gold for the Panther, you accept, but before the gold can exchange hands, an 
                        argument erupts between you and the hunting party over what share of the gold everyone will get.
                        <br><br>
                        As the argument gets louder, you and the hunter's begin to push each other around. A hunter 
                        pushes you and you fall onto the Panther, accidentally smashing the hand mirror. The Panther, 
                        no longer distracted by its own reflection, snarls loudly and attacks you and the hunters as 
                        the Merchant escapes to safety.

                        Deciding to use the Panther as bait to capture a dragon, you and the hunters set off to the 
                        arid lands in search of a Dragon. Travelling for several days and nights, you and the hunters 
                        are exhausted by the heat and decide to set up a camp at the base of a hill dotted with small 
                        caves.
                        <br><br>
                        In the middle of the night you wake up - something doesn't feel right - and you decide to wander 
                        the camp. As you walk through the camp ground, the Panther begins to stir and wakes. The air seems 
                        to shimmer and shine and before you know it a fearsome serpent with wings appears!

                        This must be a Dragon! You stand frozen in fear as the Dragon seems to coil up ready to strike at 
                        you. As the Dragon sets to attack you, a fearsome roar stuns you both - the Panther has noticed the 
                        Dragon and as one of its enemies has let out a vicious snarl and a sweet-smelling breath comes from 
                        its mouth.
                        <br><br>
                        The Panther manages to break loose from its binding and escapes into the distance as the Dragon 
                        seems frozen by its roar and breath. Taking a deep breath, you cautiously approach the frozen Dragon 
                        for a closer look...

                    <br>
                    You decide to pursue the Phoenix. You’ve heard of the creature before, but you’ve never seen one 
                    in the flesh. A note your Uncle has scribbled at the bottom of the page outlines the address of a 
                    local spice merchant. A long arrow stemming from the note indicates that the address and the 
                    Phoenix are connected. 
                    <br><br>
                    You make your way into town and find the man. He is small, and his accent is unlike any you have 
                    ever heard before. His stall has the scent of every spice one’s nose could imagine; paprika, 
                    frankincense, peppercorns of every variety… the list was extensive. You briefly discuss the mission 
                    your uncle has sent you on, the man nods in thought. 
                    <br><br>
                    “Ah yes, I knew your Great Uncle Philip well. I understand the work he has sent you to complete 
                    is incredibly important too. I tell you what, I will be travelling back through India and Egypt 
                    to collect more wares for my shop tomorrow. I know both of these places are of great importance 
                    to the story of the Phoenix. I would be honored if you were to join me.”

                    You go with the man to Egypt. It takes you several months to make your way there and when you 
                    arrive at your destination you are informed that it was once the site of ancient Heliopolis. You 
                    make camp just outside town with your now close friend, whom you’ve come to know as Anasti.
                    <br><br>
                    As the day fades and the sun sets, you see some camels making their way towards you. On their 
                    backs are bags and satchels, and they are being led by a small group of men. Though the idea of an 
                    unfamiliar group such as this approaching you, Anasti doesn’t appear concerned by their presence. 
                    <br><br>
                    “More merchants, much like myself. You can tell by their bags. Don’t fear my friend.”
                    <br><br>
                    It turns out that the men were in fact merchants, and lovely people at that. They join your camp and the group of you share stories and break bread together. You grow to trust the men and decide to share the details of your quest with them. One of them offers to tell you a story about the very creature you seek, another offers to show you a place in a more remote part of town where he believes some Phoenix feathers may be for sale. The final one offers to show you around town the next day. You decide to…

                    it to the shore line. After waiting for what feels like hours, some local fishermen spot you and 
                    send a dingy out to help you. Once rescued and safely ashore, the men offer you some food and a 
                    place to stay. The group of you exchange tales from the high seas, and as the night draws on you 
                    begin to trust these men. You decide to share the details of your quest.

                    the Christian faith prevails there is a belief that the Phoenix is a metaphor for Jesus Christ, who 
                    arose after three days and nights. In my religion of Hinduism, we believe that the soul is eternal, 
                    and that it can inhabit multiple bodies over the course of eternity. It only makes sense that the 
                    Phoenix would be resurrected.”

                    use here in India. From the ashes the new form begins to grow: first a worm, then a small bird, and 
                    finally the Phoenix in all its glory, just as it was before its death. Typically, this all occurred 
                    on an altar prepared by a priest in Heliopolis. Before it makes its journey from India to Egypt, the 
                    great bird will fly through the frankincense tree, filling its wings with precious spices.”

                    in the next life. In our religion the Phoenix is known as the god Garuda, who represents birth and 
                    heaven. Because of his ties to Vishnu, Garuda also represents justice and fighting against evil. 
                    Perhaps these righteous causes are the reason the Phoenix continues to resurrect as himself in his

                    There are many interesting and friendly people there, not least of whom is a merchant named 
                    Thomas. Upon hearing that you are new to the area, the man offers to show you around the city 
                    so you can get your bearings. You gratefully accept before heading upstairs for the rest of the

                    “I’m gonna go and find that bloody bird myself, it’s going to make me rich!” The man growls, 
                    before taking off into the city, never to be seen again.

                    <br><br>
                    “There is a magnificent bird, with luminous red feathers that resides in the depths of India. 
                    It lives for as long as five hundred years, that is until it commences a tremendous ritual of 
                    death and rebirth. When is completes its life cycle, the bird flies through the contorted branches 
                    of the frankincense tree, filling its wings with the world’s most sort after and sacred spices. 
                    Then, as Spring commences in the city of Heliopolis, a priest covers an altar with twigs and 
                    kindling. The Phoenix flies to the city and upon seeing the altar, lights a fire there only to 
                    be consumed by it.”
                    <br><br>
                    “Seems like an odd thing to do, no?” comments one of the merchants.
                    <br><br>
                    “Well it does, until you hear the rest of the story, you twit. Now shut up and listen. Where was 
                    I? Oh yes, now the day after the bird has sacrificed its own life to the flame, a small, 
                    sweet-smelling worm can be found in its ashes. On the second day, this worm becomes a small 
                    bird. On the third, well… the bird takes the form of the Phoenix again. Once this incredible 
                    process has taken place, the bird returns to its place of origin, in India. That, my friends, 
                    is the tale of the Phoenix.”
                    <br><br>
                    You all sit around for a while longer. The merchant who offered to take you for a tour around 
                    town informs you that he still intends to go there tomorrow, if you’re interested. You decide

                    site of ancient Heliopolis. He takes you past libraries and bazaars, holy buildings and less than 
                    holy ‘massage parlors’. You finally take leave of your friend outside the market stand of an old 
                    man, who is selling scrolls and prints of varying descriptions. You approach him and ask if you 
                    can go through his wares, a question he answers with a nod and a grunt. There’s parchments about 
                    Dragons and Basilisks, even a page or two about Unicorns. You finally find one about the Phoenix.

                    alight before being reborn. <br><br>
                    All of a sudden your nose is overwhelmed with the sweet smell of frankincense and about a

                    You shield your eyes from the sun and gaze skyward. A

                    timing of this is perfect, the bird must be at the very end of its lifecycle! You hatch a plan 
                    and move to act on it straight away. Gathering as much kindling as you can from nearby houses and 
                    shopfronts, you place it all on the flat altar. Then you step back. The screeching has stopped and 
                    you can see the bird slowly descend on its new pyre. It’s breathtaking; all of its feathers are a 
                    rich red or purple colour, and although it isn’t as large as you were expecting, it still has an 
                    imposing presence. The creature looks at you gratefully, catching your eye before it sets the 
                    kindling below it ablaze. Over the next few days you document and sketch the resurrection process 
                    of the great bird before returning home to pursue the rest of the creatures on your uncle’s 
                    list.

        You decide to pursue the Hydrus, one of the more obscure creatures on your uncle’s list. Next to the 
        creature’s name is a drawing of what appears to be a crocodile, you’re unsure though because you’ve 
        never seen one in the flesh. Luckily your friend, a healer in the town, knows a great deal about 
        fantastical creatures. You decide to travel to her house.
        <br><br>
     At her house your friend Calypso analyses the crude drawing, “Hmm yes. That is a crocodile if ever I have 
     seen one, although I must admit they are more fierce in the flesh.”
     <br><br>
     “Do you know where I can find one of these creatures? Are they in they rivers? Oceans?”
     <br><br>
     “Crocodiles prefer fresh water, that is true, but you will not find them around here my friend. To see these 
     ancient beasts you will need to travel to the waters of the Nile in Egypt.”

        You thank Calypso for her wisdom and continue on your way. In the port you find a ship that will 
        take you all the way to Egypt. Once you arrive and are offloaded into the city of Cairo, you are 
        inundated with new smells and sights. There are people bustling all around. After scanning the area 
        you notice in the distance a large italicised ‘i’, “Ah ha! A tourist information centre!” 
        <br><br>
     You hastily make your way there. Once inside a man at the front desk greets you warmly.
     <br><br>
     “Hello there traveller, how may I help you today? I should let you know that I have special offers 
     available on three tours around the city at the moment - they’re 50% off!”
     <br><br>
     “That sounds great actually, mind telling me about them?”
     <br><br>
     “The first is a boat ride down the Nile, with lunch included by the riverside. The second, a tour of 
     our ancient landmarks, such as the site of Heliopolis. The third, and this is my favourite, is a 
     walking tour through the markets of Cairo, it shows off the city’s broad range of foods, spices, 
     fabrics and precious wares.”

    You decide to pay for a tour of…

    The markets

        Egypt? You don’t have time to go to Egypt! There’s plenty of fresh water here in England, you’re sure 
        you can find one of these beasts a little closer to home. You thank Calypso for her wisdom and continue 
        on your way. You make your way down to the riverside nearby, it’s quiet. No birds chirping, no small 
        animals rustling around. Something’s wrong, you can feel it. Maybe you got lucky and one of those 
        crocodiles does infact inhabit the waters here. Then your stomach drops, because you hear a 
        soul-shattering howl. It’s a pack of wild dogs and they look like they haven’t eaten in ages. 
        Luckily for them, you look like a tasty snack. Unluckily for you, it’s dinner time.

                The Nile

        “Really? I mean it’s just a big long river, nothing special. Okay then, here’s your ticket. Don’t forget 
        to inscribe a review on the tablet out the front.”
        <br><br>
        You arrive at the pick up location down by the river. A large wooden boat with a thatched awning makes 
        its way to you and the other tour passengers. You’re all loaded on board and the tour begins.
        <br><br>
        “Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Nile River Tour, my name is Chione and I’ll be your guide for today. 
        Lunch will be served just after noon and we ask that you please do not put any arms or legs over the 
        sides of the boat, as they may be abruptly torn from your body by crocodiles.”
        <br><br>
   Of course, crocodiles! The clue that Uncle Philip gave me. The Hydrus must be nearby. You learn a lot during 
   the first half of your tour, but nothing particularly helpful with your quest. The boat pulls up to the 
   riverside for lunch and you hitch to a jetty near a small tree-shaded area. Now’s your opportunity, you 
   seek out your tour guide and ask her about the mythical beast you seek. 
   <br><br>
        “The Hydrus huh? Wow you don’t get too many people asking about that one. Listen not a lot is known 
        about it but I can tell you all the information I have.”
        <br><br>
        “That would be fantastic if you could. I hear they may be affiliated with the crocodiles of the Nile?”
        <br><br>
   The tour guide nods her head, “Yeah you could say that, or you could say they’re ancient enemies. Hydruses 
   are known to prey on crocodiles, they’ll coat themselves with slippery mud on the banks of the river before 
   sliding into the crocodile’s open mouth. Once inside the belly...well…” the tour guide trails off.
   <br><br>
        “Come on you can tell me, I’m not squeamish.”
        <br><br>
        “Once inside the belly the Hydrus just sorta… eats its way out of the crocodile, consuming the animal 
        from the inside out, killing it.”
        <br><br>
        “But why?”
        <br><br>
        “My understanding is that the crocodile signifies Hell, and the Hydrus represents your Christian Jesus. 
        The whole process is analogous for Jesus travelling through Hell to free trapped souls.” 
        <br><br>
        This information has been incredibly helpful, you’re able to come up with a few plans to catch the 
        Hydrus. You decide to choose…
        <br><br>
   Wait by the river, near a bask of crocodiles.
   <br>
   Ask the tour guide if you can use her boat.

        You wait in line, talking to your fellow group members. There’s a man from a town not far away from where you grew up, and a young couple 
        who’s visiting all the way from Russia. The tour guide greets you and you start on your way. The streets are packed to the brim with people, 
        and all incredibly narrow. The twists and turns make it hard to keep up with your group. Before you know it you are lost completely in the 
        middle of Cairo.

        You thank the tour guide for her help and head out on your own down the banks of the river. The sun is beating down quite heavily, 
        making you kind of delirious. Because of this, you decide to locate a bask of crocodiles in the hope that maybe a wild Hydrus would also be 
        lurking nearby. It doesn’t take long before you a group of the beasts on the bank. You wait for a while behind a tuft of reeds, but 
        eventually the sun becomes too much to bear. You decide to go for a quick dip in the water. Big mistake. You barely make it waist 
        deep before you feel a tremendous pain shoot up your leg. Then you see the blood. You’ve been caught by a crocodile hiding in the 
        murky water. So long friend, it’s been nice knowing you.

        <br><br>
        “I don’t suppose you could loan me your boat for an hour to catch one of these creatures? I need to locate some live crocodiles to use as 
        bait but it would be a whole lot safer for me if I were to do so from the boat.”
        <br><br>
        “Oh no, absolutely not. You’re insane for even asking.
        <br><br>
        You press your guide further but it’s not use, she’s adamant that you will not be using her boat. She’s keeping a close eye on you 
        too now, so it’s not like you can even abscond with the vessel. Sometimes it’s just better to say sorry rather than please.

        <br><br>
     “Just keep an eye out for crocs!”
     <br><br>
    Once you’re a good distance away from her you run over to the boat. You untether it from the jetty and the current immediately begins to 
    carry you away. You can hear the tour guide cursing you from the bank of the river. “Thief! Thief!” you hear her scream. But you’re not a 
    thief! You fully intend to return the boat to her at a later time. 
    <br><br>
     The boat whisks you down the river and it isn’t long before you encounter a large group of crocodiles basking in the sun. You throw the 
     anchor overboard, nearly throwing your back out as you do so. The boat comes to an abrupt halt and all is quiet except for the rushing of 
     the river beneath you. Your eyes dart around the area where the crocodiles are. Finally you think you’ve spotted something peculiar. There’s 
     a pair of wings peaking out above a cluster of reeds. Funny though, they don’t look like those of a bird, more like a gigantic bee’s? Surely 
     this is the creature. The wings dip down below the plant life, then you see a small dog-like foot step out from behind the scrub. Then a nose, 
     the creature looks like a slender fox, or a mongoose. You watch it lather itself in mud, rolling around, ensuring every whisker has a thick 
     coating of the slippery stuff. It then skulks its way over to the crocodiles, selecting its prey carefully. It slides into the mouth of a 
     sleeping croc, who doesn’t even stir during the process. Then it’s gone.

    <br><br>
     There’s no movement for a couple minutes and you think the event is over. Then, all of a sudden, you hear a tremendous hiss come from the 
     ancient reptile. It wakes up and begins to writhe in pain. Its belly swells and before you know it, the fox-like creature has popped its 
     head out of the crocodile’s abdomen. You mind is blown, the tour guide was right! You sketch the creature quickly, trying carefully to get 
     its features down as accurately as possible. When you return home you write about the amazing experience at length. As for the tour guide’s 
     boat well… I’m sure she’ll find it one day.

                Visit Chicken Coop
        </div>
        Thinking of Uncle Philip’s cryptic note talking about the basilisk being a “serpent fowl”, you decide 
        that the chicken coop could be the best place to go to and check out the fowl nearest to you. 
        <br><br>
        Entering the coop, you are comforted by the soft clucking of the chickens, and notice the many eggs 
        left for the maids to collect for the kitchen. You think to yourself you may as well collect the eggs 
        while you’re here, and manage to fill a basket with them.
        <br><br>
        You decide to take the eggs to:

        You haven’t visited the underground grotto in a while - it always gave you the creeps with all the 
        statues of scary and unfamiliar creatures in the flickering torchlight. Perhaps there might be clues 
        hidden here to help you find a Basilisk...after all, Uncle Philip is rumoured to have designed the 
        grotto himself.
        <br><br>
        Before you start exploring the dark, dank grotto, you remember its entry is located at the centre of 
        the great hedge maze. You can’t quite remember if the correct path to the grotto is from the North-West 
        entry or the South-East entry.

        As you walk along the bank of the stream, you just can’t shake the feeling of guilt for leaving the little 
        weasel alone under the tree. While weasels might be considered dirty animals, they are clever and actually 
        rather cute… you wonder if you made the proper Christian decision leaving it to fend for itself.
        <br><br>
        Lost in your train of thought, you step on a wet, mossy rock by the bank of the stream. You slip and fall into the 
        shallow stream, hitting your head, knocking yourself unconscious. Unfortunately, your unconscious body lands in 
        the stream and while the stream is shallow, you nevertheless drown.

        You slowly approach the shivering little weasel and crouch down to offer it a piece of cheese from your pocket. 
        The weasel nibbles the cheese and affectionately rubs its head against your hand in thanks. You pick it up and 
        carry it home, where you ask the gamekeeper for advice on how to raise the kit.
        <br><br>
        The gamekeeper tells you to feed the weasel its favourite foods, including eggs as a treat to help with training. 
        They also mention an old story of how the weasel is the only creature that can kill a strange creature with the 
        body of a rooster and the tail of a snake - a basilisk.
        <br><br>
        You spend several weeks bonding with the weasel and training it to do simple tricks! It truly is a clever little 
        creature! As you begin to think about leaving home to explore new lands and search for a basilisk, a travelling 
        circus comes to the local village. You decide to visit the circus, and the weasel follows you along. 
        <br><br>
        The leader of the circus notices the weasel walking alongside you and asks you why a wild creature is so friendly 
        to you. You explain it is your pet and that you have trained it to do many tricks. The circus leader is fascinated 
        and thinks the weasel would be a great addition to their circus and asks if you would give it to them.

        You don’t want to just give away the weasel you raised, so you decide to:

        You head into the small village near your family estate and wander the market to find someone to sell your eggs to. 
        As you wander through the market stalls, you come across a person dressed in colourful but tattered robes and long, 
        twisted grey hair. The person turns to you and smiles crookedly, saying “Hello young adventurer, word around the 
        market is you’re continuing your Uncle’s work to find a basilisk… As a sorcerer, I am quite familiar with this beast
         - ‘Little King’ it be known as in different languages, it is also known as the ‘King of Serpents’.... For more tales

        Without thinking you hand over six of your eggs and the sorcerer continues: “Little King, King of Serpents, lover of 
        dry places, the basilisk’s power be its deadly gaze, hiss and stench… Its bite will make ye afeared of water and only 
        one creature can kill it - a clever little creature that chases mice and snakes…”. With that, the sorcerer turns to

        the maids or cooks, but they’re all so busy bustling around with their chores and gossiping that they don’t notice you. 
        As you’re about to leave, you overhear a maid tell the cook interesting things they’ve heard at the market: “Oi, did ya
         hear? Apparently there’s a mad sorcerer in the village market telling strange tales! Eddard heard tell the story of a 
         vile beastie that prefers the dry, Arid Lands with deathly powers. It be called the “Little King.”.

        Phew! After a few dead ends, you eventually make it to the entry of the underground grotto and hear the steady drip of 
        water coming from the dark space beyond. Fortunately you have a flint with you and grabbing an old torch from the wall 
        nearby, light it so you can find your way about the grotto.
        <br><br>
        The cavern-like space has a row of small stone statues on marble stands along one side. As you approach them, they cast 
        strange shadows in the firelight - strange creatures that don’t look like anything you’ve ever seen before. You notice 
        that each of the statues has a word engraved into the base. The one nearest to you seems to be broken. Reading its 
        engraving, it says “Basilisk” - how exciting! You hurriedly look it over and see if you can piece it back together to get 
        some idea of what a Basilisk might look like.
        <br><br>
        As you start to piece the statue back together, you wonder what this Basilisk could be? The statue seems to be a combination of a Rooster, with the tail of a snake - how strange! You notice that there also seems to be a handful of yellow sand on the stand - this doesn’t seem to be native to your area.

        takes the weasel from you, it deeply scratches your hand.

        You head home, however, an infection sets in your open scratch and you become fevered the next day. In your delirious

                                            Though the unicorn is mostly associated as a white horse with a 
                                            single horn on its forehead in current popular culture, in medieval 
                                            bestiaries, the unicorn could have the body of a goat, ass or a 
                                            horse. It has great speed, is strong and fierce and cannot be 
                                            captured unless a maiden attracts it.
                                            <br><br>
                                            In bestiaries, unicorns signify Jesus Christ, and its horn signifies 
                                            the unity between God and Christ.

                                            Unicorns feature heavily in fantasy genres and pop-culture today.

                                            The greatest of all the serpents, the dragon is usually associated

                                            The phoenix is a creature known in many ancient stories and has many 
                                            variations. In medieval bestiaries, the Phoenix has two main stories 
                                            it is known by: one story is that the phoenix lives in India, goes 
                                            to a Frankincense tree for the spice and is reborn from flames from 
                                            an altar in Heliopolis as a worm before growing back into a phoenix.
                                             The other story is explores how the phoenix is from Arabia and how
                                              there is only one phoenix in the world at any one time.
                                              <br><br>
                                            The phoenix’s rebirth from flames signifies Jesus Christ’s 
                                            resurrection after his crucifixion.

                                            Just like its representation in medieval bestiaries, phoenix’s 
                                            continue to be associated with rebirth and regeneration. They are 
                                            popular creatures in fantasy genres and popular culture. Popular 
                                            references to and of phoenix’s include: Fawkes the phoenix from the 
                                            Harry Potter series and X-Men comic book character Jean Grey

                                                While the basilisk in modern popular culture is depicted more as 
                                                a snake or serpent, in many medieval bestiaries, it is shown as 
                                                a creature with the body of a rooster and the tail of a snake. 
                                                In the British Library’s Royal MS 12 C. xix, there are several 
                                                creatures associated with the basilisk as part of the ‘serpent’ 
                                                genus, including the Regulus and Sibilis.

                                                <strong>Real or Mythical?</strong><br>
                                                This creature is mythical!<br>
                                                The basilisk is a combination of a rooster’s body with a snake’s 
                                                tail. A recent depiction of a basilisk in pop-culture is the 
                                                basilisk from the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 
                                                (book and film).

                                <p>风拂着你的帆。您的船员早已抛弃了这艘船，因为该船pre可危
                                        向海岸线上锯齿​​状的岩石。这个岛甚至都不应该在这里。没有在任何地图上。你
                                        许多错误的决定导致您到这一点。随着您的船越来越靠近海岸线，
                                        海浪在沉船的侧面碰撞并起泡沫，您最后决定放弃船身并潜水
                                        落水。您疯狂地向岸边游泳。气喘吁吁地吞食盐水。您到达了感觉就像沙丘的感觉
                                        随着波浪在你周围破裂而崩溃...
                                        <br><br>
                                        The wind lashes at your sails. Your crewmates have long since abandoned the vessel as it veers precariously
                                        towards jagged rocks on the shoreline. This island shouldn't even be here. It wasn't on any maps. You rue 
                                        the many wrong decisions that have led you to this point. As your boat inches closer and closer towards the shoreline,
                                        waves crashing and foaming against the side of the sinking ship, you make one last decision to abandon ship and dive 
                                        overboard. You swim frantically towards the shore. Panting, puffing, swallowing saltwater. You reach what feels like a sandbank
                                        and collapse as the waves break around you...
                                </p>
                                <p>You awake, dazed and confused. Silence surrounds you. As the sun breaks through the clouds on this god-forsaken island
                                        you think to yourself "Something has to be done." Do you:
                                </p>
